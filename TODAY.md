## ðŸ¥‡ Trails (Visual Rhythm Visualization)
*Estimated: 1 full session - Complex visual system*

### Core Concept
Complete the core Spatializer vision: rhythm becomes a spatial trail across time. Pulsehead moves vertically with easing curves, leaving behind trails that visualize groove and anticipation.

### Key Features
- Y-axis pulsehead animation with musical easing
- Continuous trail rendering (bspline curves)  
- Time flow visualization (left-to-right movement)
- Grid system integration from design docs

### Technical Scope
- Three.js integration for trail rendering
- EaseLibrary for arrival curve patterns
- Timeline/history system for trail data
