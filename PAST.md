### Phase 1: Flashing Dot with Preset BPM

**Goal:** Create a working metronome with a gray dot that flashes red on each beat, precisely synced to a configurable BPM using Tone.js.

**Success Criteria - ALL COMPLETED:**
- [x] Monorepo structure set up (client/ and server/ folders)
- [x] React + Vite + TypeScript frontend initialized
- [x] Tone.js dependency installed and working
- [x] Gray circle renders at screen center
- [x] Circle flashes red precisely on beat (no drift)
- [x] BPM is configurable (60-200 BPM range)
- [x] Play/pause controls work smoothly
- [x] Visual timing stays locked to Tone.Transport

**BONUS COMPLETED:**
- [x] Added proper tick sound (not annoying beep)
- [x] Fixed timing precision with direct DOM manipulation
- [x] Documented timing architecture in CLAUDE.md

**Key Technical Achievement:** Discovered and solved React state timing lag (16-33ms) by using direct DOM manipulation for beat-synchronized visuals while keeping React for UI components.

### Phase 2: Lyrics Preview with Beat-Synced Word Highlighting

**Goal:** Transform Spatializer from a visual metronome into a lyrical rhythm experience where THE WORDS ARE THE SYNC. Text files with markup trigger word highlighting on beats.

**Success Criteria - ALL COMPLETED:**
- [x] Parse bracket markup syntax: `[word]` and `[-]` (silent beats)
- [x] Display full line of text on screen with clean typography
- [x] Turn marked words red precisely on metronome beats
- [x] Maintain sample-accurate timing from Phase 1
- [x] Handle beat counting and word sequence mapping (4 beats per line)
- [x] Clean UI integration with redesigned top-right controls
- [x] Hide `[-]` rest marks from display while preserving timing
- [x] Fix off-by-one errors in beat calculation

**BONUS COMPLETED:**
- [x] Cool BPM slider with gradient fill and custom styling
- [x] Transparent play/pause button (just emoji, no circle)
- [x] Console logging for beat debugging: "Beat 0: word"
- [x] Proper OOP architecture fix in BeatScheduler (lazy initialization)
- [x] Line advancement timing perfected (every 4 beats)

**Key Technical Achievement:** Successfully synchronized lyrics to beats with sample-accurate timing, creating a karaoke-style experience where words flash red precisely on their musical beats.

### Phase 3: Trails (Visual Rhythm Visualization)

**Goal:** Complete the core Spatializer vision where rhythm becomes a spatial trail across time. Pulsehead moves vertically with easing curves, leaving behind trails that visualize groove and anticipation.

**Success Criteria - COMPLETED:**
- [x] Y-axis pulsehead animation with musical easing implemented
- [x] Continuous trail rendering using bspline curves
- [x] Time flow visualization (left-to-right movement)
- [x] Grid system integration from design docs
- [x] Three.js integration for trail rendering
- [x] EaseLibrary for arrival curve patterns
- [x] Timeline/history system for trail data

**Key Technical Achievement:** Successfully implemented the core Spatializer vision with visual trails that capture the spatial nature of rhythm across time.
