### Phase 1: Flashing Dot with Preset BPM

**Goal:** Create a working metronome with a gray dot that flashes red on each beat, precisely synced to a configurable BPM using Tone.js.

**Success Criteria - ALL COMPLETED:**
- [x] Monorepo structure set up (client/ and server/ folders)
- [x] React + Vite + TypeScript frontend initialized
- [x] Tone.js dependency installed and working
- [x] Gray circle renders at screen center
- [x] Circle flashes red precisely on beat (no drift)
- [x] BPM is configurable (60-200 BPM range)
- [x] Play/pause controls work smoothly
- [x] Visual timing stays locked to Tone.Transport

**BONUS COMPLETED:**
- [x] Added proper tick sound (not annoying beep)
- [x] Fixed timing precision with direct DOM manipulation
- [x] Documented timing architecture in CLAUDE.md

**Key Technical Achievement:** Discovered and solved React state timing lag (16-33ms) by using direct DOM manipulation for beat-synchronized visuals while keeping React for UI components.
